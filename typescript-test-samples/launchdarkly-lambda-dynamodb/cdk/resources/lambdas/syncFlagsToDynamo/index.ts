/*
    This function can be used to initially pull all the flag values
    from LaunchDarkly and store them in a DynamoDB table.

    IMPORTANT: This is intended as a backend function to be called
    via a webhook. It should not part of the typical request path.

    The preferred way of doing this is via the Relay Proxy
    (see https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/relay-proxy/)
